Specific instructions not to user jQuery :(

In this exercise I used Bootstrap cards instead of buttons.  This ended up being a poor decision as I was looking for a few of the attributes specific to buttons.

I also had a hard time passing variables between .js files.  I will need to brush up on that.

I'll also add that a bit of psudo coding would have expedited this project.  Its a skill that i need to continue to develop and apply more consistantly.
